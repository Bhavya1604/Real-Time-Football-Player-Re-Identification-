Real-Time Player Re-Identification & YOLO Tracking

## üìå **Project Purpose**
This project demonstrates real-time player detection and stable ID assignment (Re-Identification, or ReID) in football videos.

It combines:
- **YOLOv11** (Ultralytics) for detecting players, referees, goalkeepers, etc.
- **OSNet** (Torchreid) for ReID, so the same player keeps the same global ID even when detection IDs change.
- Real-time visualization to see tracking quality.

## üì¶ **Files & their purpose**
| File / Folder | Purpose |
|---------------|--------:|
| `player_re-identification.py` | Main script: real-time detection + ReID tracking with global IDs |
| `real_time_detection_yolo.py` | Run YOLOv11 detection only (no ReID) ‚Äì see how good the model is |
| `yolo_detection_savetrue.py` | YOLO detection and save frames or video |
| `testcuda.py` | Check if CUDA (GPU) is available |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `data_videos/` | Sample football videos to test |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è I discovered the custom class names (`player`, `referee`, etc.) by printing `box` in `real_time_detection_yolo.py`.
